<h2>Fo sho'</h2>

<p>While the things listed below are general recommendations on how to approach issues - admins should use your own judgement before anything else.  Afterall, we've all gotten our admin status because we're experience on this server and the community trusts us.</p>
  
<p>Always use the minimum amount of power necessary to resolve an issue. If, for example, a player is disrespecting members, and asking the player to stop may resolve the problem, that's preferred over gagging or kicking.</p>

<p>While we allow swearing on the server, and most of us tolerate the occasional derogatory term, our members (especially the young ones) may be easily offended or influenced.  They should never be expected to "get used to" hateful language.  This may only be a game, but it still affects the mindset and the language that young members use outside of it.</p>

<p>Members may not always feel safe speaking up for themselves.  It's our responsibility to check in with them when we think someone else has taken things too far.  Make sure they know we've got their backs.</p>

<p>When warnings/gags/kicks don't solve a problem, sometimes even a 10 minute ban won't work. If banning for multiple days, you'll need to specify the time in minutes. <span class="yellow">1500 minutes = 25 hours</span>.</p>
