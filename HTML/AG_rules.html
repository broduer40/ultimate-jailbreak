<a id="how_to_play"><h2>How To Play</h2></a>

<p><span class="blue">Counter Terrorists</span> play the role of <span class="blue">prison guards</span> meanwhile <span class="red">Terrorists</span> play the role of <span class="red">prisoners</span>. To be a guard you must have a microphone.</p>

<p><span class="blue">Guards</span> take turns calling days and making prisoners fight to the death, race or compete in any way until one prisoner is left alive. As a guard it is your duty and responsibility to call fun days using the map and activites menu while keeping the prisoners in control and avoiding being overrun by these rebellious, blood thirsty criminals.</p>

<p><span class="red">Prisoners</span> can choose to follow the commands of the day and compete against fellow inmates or rebel and try to take out the guards. The last prisoner remaining earns "Last request" and gets to play a game of his/her choosing against each guard alive.</p>





<a id="getting_help"><h2>Getting Help</h2><a>
<span class="yellow">OUR ADMINS ARE HERE TO HELP YOU!!!!</a>

<p>To get a list of all admins on the server, type <span class="green">/admins</span>.</p>
<p>If no admins are on, type <span class="green">/vips</span> to get a list of all VIPs.</p>

<p>Need to communicate with an admin? Have "<span class="yellow">@</span>" be the first character you use in team chat, and that message will be sent to all admins.</p>

<p><span class="yellow">Example:</span>  say_team: @Hi admins, player #5 continues to freeshoot me -- could someone please remind him of the rules?</p>

<p><span class="yellow">Example #2:</span>  say_team: @This player keeps insulting me and I don't feel safe speaking up -- can someone help?</p>


<a id="terminology"><h2>Terminology</h2></a>
<ul id="terminology_list">
<li><span class="green">Unrestricted freeday:</span> A day in which the prisoners are able to roam the map with no restrictions. Guards may not call any commands during the day.</li>

<li><span class="green">Restricted freeday:</span> A day in which the guards are able to restrict a total of two specific locations but may otherwise not call any commands. Cells, hallways and guard spawn are never to be restricted.</li>

<li><span class="green">Ratio freeday:</span>  Called in the event the guard-to-prisoner ratio is off. The first guard to die during the round must transfer to the prisoners team.</li>

<li><span class="green">AFK check:</span> Giving a prisoner who is not moving inside of his/her cell five seconds to get back into the game before killing them.  A prisoner who is seen moving inside his/her cell by a guard is not considered being AFK.</li>

<li><span class="green">Taunting:</span> A guard getting within a prisoner's knife range or in the area of the current event (e.g. the cage during a cage day, race track during a race day, etc.). A guard that is in the way of a prisoner following a command is taunting (being directly in front of the cage if prisoners are told to report to the cage).</li>

<li><span class="green">Rebelling:</span> When a prisoner does not follow a command or attacks a guard without justification. A rebel prisoner may be killed on sight unless forgiven by the commanding guard.</li>

<li><span class="green">Commander:</span> The guard in charge of the day. S/he is responsible for moving the day forward. The first guard to call commands for a day becomes the commander.</li>

<li><span class="green">Freeshooting:</span> Unjustly or wrongfully damaging a prisoner.  A prisoner who is freeshot may ask a guard for a full heal.</li>

<li><span class="green">Warning shot:</span> Shooting a prisoner as a warning for not following a commander's current command. This prisoner is not elligible for a heal from a guard unless a guard allows it.  A death resulting from multiple warning shots is a legal kill.</li?>

<li><span class="green">Freekill:</span> The unjust or wrongful death of a prisoner. In the case of a freekill, a guard is required to award that prisoner an unrestricted freeday the next day. Multiple freekills may lead to the guard being banned from the guard team.</li>

<li><span class="green">Mass freekilling:</span> A premeditated, intentional, and or random killing of prisoners, generally in mass numbers. This behavior is not tolerated and will ultimately lead to a permanent ban.</li>

<li><span class="green">Team-killing:</span> Killing members of one's own team. Team-killing is allowed only on freedays, special days and with the use of vehicles during vehicle events. Anyone found purposely team-killing otherwise may be kicked or banned.</li>

<li><span class="green">Ghosting:</span> A dead player revealing another player's position on the map, health level, weapon, etc.</li>
</ul>


<a id="rules"><h2>Rules</h2></a>
<ol id="rule_list">

<a id="rules_general"><h3 class="yellow">General</h3></a>
<li>Guards are required to have a microphone. Only admins can mic check. Microphones must be used and have clear, audible quality. If not, the guard will be asked to fix it or be transferred to the prisoner team.</li>

<li>The prisoner to guard ratio must be at least 2:1. Do not stack the guard team.</li>

<li>The first day of a new map is always an unrestricted freeday. Guards are not allowed to intentionally kill themselves to bypass this day.</li>

<li>Instructions for the day must be called and the cell doors opened by a guard by [8:00].  Otherwise, it becomes an unrestricted freeday.</li>

<li>If the cell doors are opened by a prisoner, the day becomes an automatic, unrestricted freeday.</li>

<li>Punishment days, cell day lockdown and days forcing prisoners to stay in the cells are prohibited.
<span class="yellow">*Exception: Days in which prisoners are called out one by one for a special event.</span></li>

<li>If a cage day is called and a prisoner did not follow the commands but has already made it to the cage, s/he cannot be killed. The same applies to other days as well (bench day, deathrun, etc).</li>




<a id="rules_weapons"><h3 class="yellow">Weapons and Vehicles</h3></a>
  <li>Prisoners are allowed to pick up and hold weapons. A commander reserves the right to command prisoners to drop weapons and is required to countdown from 5 to 0. A guard must have seen the prisoner pick it up and can not otherwise assume.</li>
  <li>A guard may restrict the use and pickup up of weapons on any non-freeday or non-special day.</li>
  <li>A guard can kill a prisoner that shoots or aims a gun at any guard (even if the gun is empty) without a countdown or warning.
  <span class="yellow">*This applies to prisoners with freedays as well.</span></li>
  <li>All players are automatically issued a drivers license, but the license may be revoked by any guard if team killing while operating a vehicle becomes excessive.</li>






<a id="rules_rebelling"><h3 class="yellow">Rebelling</h3>
<li>Prisoners outside the cells before the day is called and the cell doors opened are considered rebelling and may be killed.</li>

<li>If a prisoner blatently rebels, he or she is considered a rebel for the rest of the day unless forgiven by the commander.  For example, catching a run-away rebeller elsewhere on the map following a freeze command does not forgive him/her from having rebelled in the first place.</li>

<li>Warning shots are preferred, but not required, over killing prisoners immediately upon rebelling.</li>






<a id="rules_commanding"><h3 class="yellow">Commanding</h3></a>
<li>There is to be only one commander at any time. All other guards should be quiet unless enforcing rules. A commander may pass command to any guard if he or she clearly states it.</li>

<li>Non-commanding guards must be assisting the commander at all times. This means guards may not wonder off, speak over the commander, or give conflicting commands.</li>

<li>Guards may not hog the commander position.  All guards must have equal opportunity to become the commander at the start of the day.</li>

<li>In the event that the commanding officer is killed or disconnects, the day immediately becomes an unrestricted freeday and all commands are void and invalid unless a new guard takes over.</li>

<li>Guards must give one of two types of commands in order to expect prisoners to follow the commands.
  <ul>
    <li><span class="green">Direct commands</span> - Does not require a countdown and must be obeyed immediately.</li>
    <li><span class="green">Standard commands</span> - Requires a countdown of at least 5 seconds.</li>
  </ul>
</li>

<li>Guards may never assume, or command, that all his/her commands are direct commands.</li>
<li>If a commander gives a command without it being a direct or standard command, a prisoner must not be punished for following it unless specifically told not to (e.g. told not to move unless a special phrase is said, or during Simon Says days).</li>

<li>By default, there are two types of freeze commands. Commanders are always allowed to give custom freeze commands.
  <ul>
    <li><span class="green">Freeze</span> - Prisoners must stay where they are but are allowed to jump or move their mouse.</li>
    <li><span class="green">AFK Freeze</span> - Prisoners may not jump, move their mouse, or otherwise make a motion.</li>
  </ul>
</li>

<li>Command stacking is defined as giving an excessive and unreasonable amount of commands at one time, which is not allowed. All commands must be clearly stated and fair to everyone.</li>

<li>New commands override old commands.</li>

<li>All commands given by guards require a reasonable amount of time to be completed. A minimum of 5 seconds is always required, and 'zero' must be said before any action is taken against the prisoner.</li>

















<a id="rules_taunting"><h3 class="yellow">Taunting</h3></a>

<li>In the event that a guard taunts, prisoners have every right to act in self defense. Once the guard is out of taunting range, a prisoner can no longer attack or pursue the guard.</li>

<li>Going into a prisoner's cell is considered a taunt and he or she reserves the right to attack the guard while the guard is in the cell without ramification.</li>

<li>If a guard taunts a prisoner, that prisoner may attack the guard without reprocusion, even if it means breaking the current command (e.g. prisoners are told to freeze inside the cage and a guard runs into the cage, causing prisoners to run after that guard).</li>

<li>Taunting does not apply to prisoners.  Therefore, guards cannot force a prisoner to move unless they are disobeying a specific command.  Prisoners coming within knifing range or attempting to knife a guard are NOT considered rebelling unless deliberately disobeying a specific command. Actual damage has to be made for a guard to act in self defense.</li>

<li>Taunting rules stay in effect even during Last Request.</li>




<a id="rules_freekills"><h3 class="yellow">Freeshooting, Freekilling and Freedays</h3></a>

<li>In the event of a mass freekill [3 or more victims], guards are required to call an unrestricted freeday the following day.</li>

<li>Collateral damage is never in effect. If a prisoners is inadvertently killed, it is still a freekill and must be be awarded a freeday.</li>

<li>If the round time has expired [0:00], an unrestricted freeday goes into effect immediately.</li>

<li>If a prisoner is awarded a freeday, but the map changes, the freeday rolls over and should be awarded on the first non-freeday of the new map.</li>

<li>Prisoners with a freeday can be killed if s/he interferes with the current day. The prisoner should be warned s/he is interfering before being killed, if the interference is not blatant.</li>







<a id="rules_afk"><h3 class="yellow">AFK Checking</h3></a>
<li>AFK checks are required for any and all prisoners. Guards must countdown from 5 to 0 before opening fire. AFK checks cannot be executed on freedays unless the AFK player is preventing the otherwise last remaining prisoner from obtaining last request.</li>

<li>If a prisoner is returning from being AFK, or has otherwise not heard the rules for the day, it is his/her responsibility to ask the commander to repeat his or her commands.  Otherwise, s/he risks being killed for not following the command for the day (e.g. if the command was to run to the cage, an AFK player might walk, which would be considered delaying).</li>







<a id="rules_restrictions"><h3 class="yellow">Restrictions</h3></a>

<li>The Reactions game cannot be called more than ONCE per day. No more than TWO prisoners may be killed.</li>

<li>Gun planting is defined as a guard deliberately giving a prisoner a weapon. This is prohibited. Prisoners however, can gun plant unless directed not to by a guard.</li>

<li>Guards are not allowed to wall prisoners [shooting prisoners that they cannot see, typically hiding behind a wall]. If a prisoner disappears behind a wall, the guard must find another method of killing them (chasing after them, nading, etc.)
<span class="yellow">*Exception: Special days</span></li>

<li>Gunrooms are always restricted to prisoners. This applies to freedays and prisoners with freedays.</li>

<li>Guards are not permitted to camp the gunroom.
<span class="yellow">*Exception: Hide and Seek Day</span></li>

<li>Vents are not allowed to be broken by guards.
<span class="yellow">*Exception: A prisoner is seen or heard inside the vent.</span></li>

<li>Vents are always restricted. This applies to freedays, special days and prisoners with freedays.  Neither prisoners nor guards are allowed to camp vents.  Prisoners may not be killed if they s/he exits the vent.</li>

<li>The shop menu may be restricted for a specific event but never for a full day.</li>

<li>Grenades cannot be restricted and prisoners may not be shot for attacking a guard with a grenade unless disobeying a specific command.</li>

<li>Freedays purchased from the shop menu are only valid ONCE every FIVE days.</li>

<li>Special days and vote days are limited to ONCE every THREE days.</li>

<li>The same day cannot be called more than TWICE in a row.</li>

<li>Glitching is not allowed. Intentional glitching of any kind is severely punishable. Please report all glitches on the forums.</li>

<li>Favoritism is not allowed.</li>

<li>Spamming mic, radio or chat is not allowed.</li>

<li>Hacking and the use of scripts will result in a permanent ban.</li>

<li>Advertisements of any kind are prohibited. Please do not advertise in other communities, either.</li>

<li>All players are to be treated with respect and common courtesy. Not following this rule may result in a gag, kick or ban from our community.</li>
</ol>

















<a id="activities"><h2>Activity Rules</h2></a>

<a id="activities_requests"><h3 class="yellow">Last Request</h3></a>
<ol>
  <li>Prisoners have 15 seconds to select a last request or they can be killed.</li>
  <li>Prisoners have 30 seconds to explain their rules.</li>
  <li>All rules must be fair and equal. Otherwise, the guard reserves the right to deny the rules.</li>
  <li>There are three types of rules for Last Request events.
    <ol>
      <li><span class="green">Standard rules</span> - Use only the weapons provided by the Last Request event (not including the knife, unless it's a knife fight). No healing, and no running away from the fight.</li>
      <li><span class="green">No rules</span> - No rules means no rules. Use at your own risk.</li>
      <li><span class="green">Custom rules</span> - the prisoner defines his or her own rules.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

<a id="activities_reactions"><h3 class="yellow">Reactions</h3></a>
<ol>
<li>When the commander calls "First Reaction," the first prisoner to perform the specific action will be killed.  The opposite applies to "Last Reaction."</li>
</ol>

<a id="activities_simon"><h3 class="yellow">Simon Says</h3></a>
<ol>
<li>When the commander says, "Simon says I'm Simon," s/he is Simon.</li>
<li>To end Simon Says you must clearly state, "Simon says Simon Says is 
over".</li>
<li>If another guard gives a command during Simon Says and a prisoner gets killed for it, it is a freekill.</li>
<li>In order for you to pass Simon Says to another guard you must say, 
"Simon Says [name of guard] is Simon".</li>
<li>A commander may not stack Simon Says commands. For example: One can say "Simon says freeze."  If the next command is "Simon says jump", prisoners must not be killed for unfreezing.
<li>Even if Simon Says has not been started, the commander saying "Simon says jump, direct command" is still a valid command.  The fact that no one is Simon does not exclude the fact that prisoners were still commanded to jump.</li>
<li>Do NOT kill people for following a command that Simon did not say if prisoners have not broken the current Simon Says command.  For example: If a guard becomes Simon, and then says "Line up in the middle of the cage" without saying 'Simon says', no one should be killed, regardless if they lined up or not. No Simon Says command has yet been made to contain prisoners in a fixed location or maintain a current activity, so the prisoners are free to move about the area of confinement until Simon issues such a command.</li>
</ol>


<a id="activities_lights"><h3 class="yellow">Red Light, Green Light</h3></a>
<ol>
<li>Commanders may not say anything that rhymes with any of the light commands, in case the commander's microphone is unclear.</li>
</ol>
