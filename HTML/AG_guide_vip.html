<h2>Rules</h2>

<p>All <span class="orange">VIPs</span> have been given their title because of their involvement in the community and their activity in the game.</p>

<p>Please remember, however, that with power comes responsibility.  You should not mic spam, especially when it means speaking over the commander or interrupting the current day.</p>

<p>Players should only be revived before the day begins (which is when the cell doors open).  A couple of seconds after is fine, too, if it's taking you a while to revive players or the player to be revived joined before doors opened.</p>

<p>Reviving a player who has been killed by a door glitch is okay, unless that player was purposely glitching the map (e.g. trying to escape out the window of jb_asylum2_ag and was killed in the process).</p>


<h2>Commands</h2>
